This project gathers survey data on personal preferences, demographics, and global health interests. The analysis will clean the data, calculate statistics, and visualize trends using R. The goal is to explore relationships between preferences, demographics, and health interests.


To code the dataset analysis, libraries like dplyr in (R) will load and clean the data by handling missing values and standardizing entries. Descriptive statistics will be calculated, and cross-tabulations will analyze relationships between variables like pet preferences and education levels. Visualization tools such as ggplot2 will create bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to display trends and insights from the data


The dataset includes survey responses detailing personal preferences (like pet choices and favorite numbers), demographic information (such as birth dates, countries, and education levels), and interests in global health topics. This structured data enables analysis of how personal and demographic factors relate to global health interests.
